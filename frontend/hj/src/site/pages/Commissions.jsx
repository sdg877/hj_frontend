            I have worked on various commissions and enjoy collaborating with clients to bring their ideas to life, creating unique and personalized artworks.

            Recently, I was commissioned by Katherine Pooley Design Studio to create a diptych on canvas. The brief called for a geometric design, with images and swatches provided for precise color matching. Using acrylic paint, I layered colors to achieve subtle blends and depth.

            For a nature-inspired project, a client requested a pair of lovebirds made from recycled materials. To achieve this, I assembled scrap metals to form the birds and mounted them on driftwood.

            Another commission allowed me to work directly in the landscape. The brief was to integrate a bird sculpture within a woodland setting. I constructed a metal base and used wire to secure pine cones and seed pods, with most of the materials sourced from the garden.
